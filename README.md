# Kechie

Kechie is an e-commerce store for shopping items (e.g. Bags, Shoes, Accessories and
Jewelries). Kechie is a brand owned by a friend of mine and this is my solution for
her need of a web store for her brand. Currently, it is almost complete, just quite
a number of touches on the design here and there and to add little other features as
requested by my Client(My Friend).

This is currently using Django with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.   
A sneak peek can be found here: https://kechies.herokuapp.com.  
As Time goes, I'll be updating and pushing changes till satisfaction. I also welcome
help from anyone and anywhere, including but not limited to the design, the
functionality, implementation and any other way possible
